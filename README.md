- Hello, I'm Johnny, but you can call me dance2
- I usually code stuff in lua, react, python, html/css and _barely_ node.js
- If you ever need to reach out to me, you can email: johnnymfbr@gmail.com
- Most of my GitHub content is private, so it usually won't show up, unless I want to share some of my content with everyone.
